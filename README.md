# Welcome to the PEACH Cancer Client App

The client app is responsible for delivering the front-end of the PEACH Cancer application. It is distinct from the [API server](https://github.com/comp204p-team35/Backend-Server), which is responsible for delivering the backend of PEACH Cancer.

[Documentation can be found here](https://peach-cancer.gitbooks.io/client/).
